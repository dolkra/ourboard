### Board access controls

All boards created using the UI are accessible to anyone with the link.

Boards with restricted access can currently only be created using the POST API (see below).

## Github Issues Integration

1. Create a board and an Area named "new issues" (case insensitive) on the board.
2. Add a webhook to a git repo, namely
    1. Use URL https://www.ourboard.io/api/v1/webhook/github/{board-id}, with board-id from the URL of you board.
    2. Use content type to application/json
    3. Select "Let me select individual events" and pick Issues only.
3. Create a new issue or change labels of an existing issue.
4. You should see new notes appear on your board

## API

For a full list of API endpoints, see https://ourboard.io/api-docs.

All POST and PUT endpoints accept application/json content.

API requests against boards with restricted access require you to supply an API_TOKEN header with a valid API token.
The token is returned in the response of the POST request used to create the board.

### POST /api/v1/board

Creates a new board. Payload:

```js
{
    "name": "board name as string",
}
```

You can also specify board access policy, including individual users by email and user email domains:

```js
{
    "name": "board name as string",
    "accessPolicy": {
        "allowList": [
            { email: "coolgirl@reaktor.com" },
            { domain: "reaktor.fi" }
        ]
    }
}
```

Response:

```js
{
    "id": "board id",
    "accessToken": "************"
}
```

The `accessToken` returned here is required for further API calls in case you set an access policy. So, make sure to save the token.

### PUT /api/v1/board/:boardId

Changes board name and, optionally, access policy. Payload is similar to the POST request above.

This endpoint always requires the API_TOKEN header.

### POST /api/v1/board/:boardId/item

Creates a new item on given board. If you want to add the item onto a specific area/container element on the board, you can
find the id of the container by inspecting with your browser.

Payload:

```js
{
    "type": "note",
    "text": "text on note",
    "container": "container element text or id",
    "color": "hexadecimal color code"
}
```

### PUT /api/v1/board/:boardId/item/:itemId

Creates a new item on given board or updates an existing one.
If you want to add the item onto a specific area/container element on the board, you can
find the id of the container by inspecting with your browser.

Payload:

```js
{
    "type": "note",
    "text": "text on note",
    "container": "container element text or id",
    "color": "hexadecimal color code",
    "replaceTextIfExists": boolean,      // Override text if item with this id exists. Defaults to false.
    "replaceColorIfExists": boolean,     // Override color if item with this id exists. Defaults to false.
    "replaceContainerIfExists": boolean, // Override container in item with this id exists. Defaults to true.
}
```

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId

Return board current state as JSON.

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/hierarchy

Return board current state in a hierarchical format (items inside containers)

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/csv

Return board current state in CSV format, where

-   A container containing only leaf items (note, text) creates a row and each item in that container gets its own column
-   Container name is a column on the left
-   Any wrapping containers also add a column on the left

### GET /api/v1/board/:boardId/history

Returns the full history of given board as JSON.

## Development

Running locally requires `docker-compose` which is used for starting the local PostgreSQL database. The script below starts the database, but you must make sure you have a working docker setup on your machine, of course.

Running locally:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Run end-to end Cypress tests against the server you just started:

-   `yarn test-e2e:dev` to run once
-   `yarn cypress` to open the Cypress UI for repeated test runs

Connect to the local PostgreSQL database

    yarn psql

### Tech stack

-   TypeScript
-   [Harmaja](https://github.com/raimohanska/harmaja) frontend library
-   WebSockets (express-ws / uWebSockets.js both!)
-   Express server
-   Typera for HTTP API

### Developing with production data

Do not run your local server against the production database, or you'll corrupt production. The server's in memory state will be out of sync with DB and bad things will happen.

Instead, do this.

1. Capture a backup and download it: `heroku pg:backups:capture`, then `heroku pg:backups:download`.
2. Restore the backup to your local database: `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d postgres://r-board:secret@localhost:13338/r-board latest.dump`
3. Start you local server using `yarn dev`

If you need the local state for a given board in localStorage, you can

1. extract the content in the browser devtools, when viewing production site in browser, using `localStorage["board_<boardid>"]`
2. Copy that string to clipboard
3. Run the following in your localhost site console:

    localStorage["board_32de1a50-09a6-4453-9b9e-ed10c56afa99"]=JSON.stringify(
    <paste content here>
    )

Copy the result string, navigate to your localhost site and paste the same value to the same localStorage key. Refresh and enjoy.

### Building and pushing the raimohanska/ourboard docker image

```
docker login
docker build . -t raimohanska/ourboard:latest
docker push raimohanska/ourboard:latest
```

## Hosting

OurBoard is made to be easy to deploy and host. It consists of a single Node.js process that needs a PostgreSQL database for storing data. Using environment variables (see below) you can set the URL for the database and optionally configure OurBoard to use S3 for image assets and Google for authentication. By default it comes without authentication / authorization and stores image assets in the local file system.

### Heroku

If it suits you, Heroku is likely to be the easiest way to host your own OurBoard server. You should be able to host your own OurBoard instance pretty easily in Heroku. This repository should be runnable as-is,
provided you set up some environment variables, which are listed below.

### Docker

OurBoard is available as a Docker image so you can deploy it with Docker or your favorite container environment of choice. To get an OurBoard docker image, you can either:

1. Use the [raimohanska/ourboard image](https://hub.docker.com/r/raimohanska/ourboard) in Docker Hub (just skip to running, it will be downloaded automatically)
2. Build it from this repository: `docker build . -t raimohanska/ourboard:latest`

You can run it like this:

1. Start a posgres database. For example, running `docker-compose up` in your local clone of this directory will start one.
2. Start the Ourboard container. Run the example script `scripts/run_dockerized.sh` to try it out.

With the example script, you'll have a setup which

-   Doesn't have authentication. See environment variables below for configuring Google authentication, which is the only supported option for now.
-   Stores uploaded assets (images) on the local filesystem. The example script binds the local directory `backend/localfiles` to be used for storage. In your own script, you'll probably want to point out a more suitable directory on your server machine.
-   Uses an absolutely insecure SESSION_SIGNING_KEY. Make sure to use a long random string instead.
-   Will benefit from a HTTPS terminating proxy. This is not included. The simple setup will use plain HTTP and respond at http://localhost:1337.

### Environment variables

Here's a most likely incomplete list of supported environment variables for the server. When developing the application locally, set these variables in `backend/.env` file.

```
DATABASE_URL          Postgres database URL. In Heroku, you can just add the PostgreSQL add on and this variable will be correctly set. The free one will get you started.
DATABASE_SSL_ENABLED  Use `true` to use SSL for database connection. Recommended.
REDIRECT_URL          Put your OurBoard application root URL here, if you want the server to redirect all requests that don't have the x-forwarded-proto=https header. For example: https://www.ourboard.io/.
ROOT_URL              Root URL used for redirects. Use https://<yourdomain>/. If you don't have authentication configured, you can omit this one.
WS_HOST_DEFAULT       Your domain name here, used for routing websocket connections. Can be omitted in simple configurations.
WS_HOST_LOCAL         Your domain name here as well. Can be omitted in simple configurations.
WS_PROTOCOL           `wss` for secure, `ws` for non-secure WebSockets. Always use wss for secure connections.
BOARD_ALIAS_tutorial  Board identifier for the "tutorial" board that will be cloned for new users. Allows you to create a custom tutorial board. For example, the value `782d4942-a438-44c9-ad5f-3187cc1d0a63` is used in ourboard.io, and this points to a publicly readable, but privately editable board
```

AWS environment variables, needed for hosting board assets on AWS S3. If these are missing, all uploaded
assests (images, videos) will be stored in the local filesystem (using the path "localfiles"),
which is a viable solution only if you have a persistent file system with backups.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       AWS access key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   Secret access key
AWS_ASSETS_BUCKET_URL   URL to the AWS bucket. For example https://r-board-assets.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com
```

Google authentication is supported. To enable this feature, you'll need to supply the following environment variables.

```
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Generic OAuth authentication is also supported as an experimental feature (only Google tested so far). To enable this feature, you'll need to supply the following environment variables.

```
OAUTH_CONFIG_URL        Your OpenID configuration endpoint. For example: https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID         Your OAuth2 client id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET     Your OAuth2 client secret
```
